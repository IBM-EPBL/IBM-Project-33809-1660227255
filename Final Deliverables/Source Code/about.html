        Conversations with customers have become the need of the hour for businesses. Now we are witnessing a paradigm shift from mass-centred to granular, account-based approach.

Banks and other financial institutions, who work closely with customers, and rely heavily on customer relationships, have always leveraged technology to assist them.

First, it was internet banking in the late 90s, then mobile banking when the smartphone revolution took over the world. Now, with the advent of AI and machine cognizance, conversational banking is on the rise.

Conversational banking is nothing but communication between a bank and its customer through text, voice, or visual interface. It adds that extra touch of personalization in customer relationships.

Conversational banking, though highly effective, comes with the hardship of effective implementation given the sheer volume of customers banks serve (or any B2C business for that matter).

That is why AI becomes extremely important in conversational banking. With chatbots and virtual assistants, banks can serve their customers effectively without spending huge amounts of time, resources, and manpower.

<br></p><p>
In 2017, some of the major banks in the US released their chatbots and virtual assistants. 
According to a survey by Celent, 85% of the banks think that AI will have significant effects on banking. 32% of the banks have already started making direct investments in it.

Customer service is the most important aspect of delivering better customer experience for banks.

The reason why chatbots are deemed to the future of banking assistance is their capability to have personal, one-to-one conversations with customers. It gives the assurance of being taken care of to customers.

Let’s now briefly look at what chatbots are and how an ideal chatbot for banking is built.

Elements of building chatbots for banking
Chatbots are nothing but software programs written to facilitate conversations. Hence, they are going to be as smart as you want them to be.

Your chatbot can be a simple button-based or advanced AI-powered contextual chatbot. The amount of sophistication you want to bring depends on the use case you are trying to solve.

A simple chatbot that tells your account balance, fetches your statement, or transfers money does not necessarily require AI. While on the other hand, a purely conversational chatbot is powered by AI and requires a lot of data to learn.

<br>Irrespective of the type, you need to consider these elements to build a great chatbot for banks:

Channels
Chat interface and conversational UI
Rich actionable messaging
Security
Natural Language Processing
Fallback to humans</p>
<p>
Let’s discuss these points in detail.<br></p>


1. <b style="color: blue;">Which channels to use?</b><p>
Chatbots can be deployed on one or multiple channels. The obvious ones are your websites and banking apps. These are the platforms where customers transact. They can also be deployed in instant messaging apps such as Facebook, Twitter, or Whatsapp.

It largely depends on the support channels you use, the audience behaviour, and your use case.

Bank of America has deployed Erica, the financial digital assistant, on their mobile app. While Wells Fargo has used the Facebook Messenger bot to kick start their chatbots journey. Going a road a little different, Capital One has developed Eno, an SMS based chatbot.

The channels are not limited to textual conversations only. With the rise of Deep Learning, voice-based virtual assistants are on a rise. Probably we interact with voice-based chatbots on a daily basis. Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, and Google Home to name a few. Few banks are leveraging voice cum text-based chatbots to widen the functionality.<br></p>

2. <b style="color: blue;">Chat interface and conversational UI</b><p>
One more reason chatbots are flouring in the banking industry is the ease of use. Instant messaging apps saw an exponential rise in the last decade.

The reason is  most human interactions are carried over short conversations. The ease of use and effort required in chatting is much lesser when compared to calling.

Hence, when you create a chatbot, make sure to keep the interface similar to that of messaging apps, often called conversational UI. Most people already have used some or other kind of messaging app. Hence the UI does not look alien and they can make an instant connection.

It also gives a feeling of personal touch and being taken care of. They mimic human to human interaction, which we have been actively using for the past decade at least.

You need not build the whole chat interface from scratch. The SaaS boom has put a plethora of options on the platter. There are solutions specifically made for customer support chat that you can integrate into your website/apps easily. Kommunicate comes with an option of directly integrating a chatbot into the customer support chat.
</p><br>
3.<b style="color: blue;"> Rich actionable messaging</b><p>
Rich actionable messaging makes the conversation interactive, fruitful, and easy to act upon. You can use buttons, lists, cards, and carousels. It helps speed up the whole process by providing visual, interactive, and beautiful elements in the chat itself.

Imagine the process where a customer needs to type all the things out and get answers to those queries. In place of this, rich messaging provides avenues for handling basic cases with the click of a button.

This makes it a win-win for both customers and banks alike. The sheer volume of customer queries received are solved faster and the customer’s need for instant gratification is satisfied.
</p><br>
4. <b style="color: blue;">Security</b><p>
Data security is extremely important for banking operations due to the involvement of financial assets. Also, a customer will be more comfortable in using conversational banking services if they trust the services.

Trust comes from ensuring good security and authentication processes. You need to have an authentication layer(s) to identify the user and authenticate transactions.
<br></p>
5.<b style="color: blue;"> Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b><p>
NLP is a branch of AI concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In simpler terms, NLP facilitates the chatbot to understand, process, and reply to user conversations.

Though all the chatbots do not necessarily require NLP (say button-based chatbots), but for delivering a better customer experience and keeping the conversation as human-like as it can be, NLP is a must.

As said earlier, the reason why chatbots are termed as the future of customer conversations is their ability to carry out a human-like conversation. The more you train your chatbot with relevant data, the better it would be.

You could either build your own NLP engine from scratch or choose from existing NLP platforms especially made for chatbots such as Rasa, Dialogflow, or IBM Watson.

Although, NLP is a relatively new and novice branch. There are multiple challenges associated with NLP. Most noticeably, the requirement of data and its inevitability to fail in certain conversations.

To give you a perspective, Capital One’s Eno understands over 2,200 terms and emojis people use to ask about their account balances. It may take more than a year to fully train and develop such a chatbot. Yet, in all their glory, chatbots are not humans and are deemed to fail at a certain point in time.

Even the leading AI researchers do not have a date or year in mind for chatbots that can carry on conversations in the same depth as that of humans. Hence, it is really important to handle such cases judiciously. What should be the ideal fallback in case the chatbot is not able to answer customer questions?
<br></p>
6. <b style="color: blue;">The fallback to humans</b><p>
The whole point of leveraging chatbots in financial services is to provide a great, personalized customer experience without spending fortunes on time and resources. But chatbots may not be able to answer all customer queries.

You should be able to handle these cases without breaking the customer experience. This is where chatbot to human handoff comes in handy. You can transfer the conversation on the basis of triggers that emphasize that the chatbot is unable to understand and answer.

    Customer support and service is difficult to achieve. Customers buy products online, make payments, and have
queries related to products as a result they want good customer service for solving their queries. Traditionally,
people use telephones to contact the customer executive. This process is very time consuming as the customers
need to wait on the line for a lot of time before their request is processed. The customers get frustrated when they
ask the same question again and again, lodge complaints and they don’t receive a response for days. Also, the cost
of phone interaction between the customer as well as executive is also more. So, to solve this issue we introduce
chatbots which is a computer program that we can talk to via text, chat or voice. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Powered chatbots, enterprises can be closer to achieving efficient and automated customer service which can
lead to better engagement and understanding [1].
According to Dr. Wallace, perhaps, the biggest market of chat bot is Entertainment Markets, in which, we can
imagine that chat bots can act as a talking book for childrenand provide foreign language instruction or can be a
tutorin the Intelligent Tutoring system. One such study used an ALICE system to help Chinese university students
practice their conversational English skills. The study was qualitative in nature and used pre-existing
conversational English skills [2]</p><p>
Eliza was the first famous chat bot, and ALICE was another milestone. The Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox
Challenge are both annual competitions which have their roots in TIG. However, these are typically text only
experiments, although some limited visual components are often added. This focus is on; however, whether with
the text exchange alone, we can replicate human “behaviour” [3].
Conversional assistants are becoming an integral part of daily life. Rasa Core and Rasa Natural Language
understanding (NLU) are easy to use tools for building conversational systems.[4]
Rasa is an essential set of tools for building more advanced and efficient AI assistants/chatbots. The benefit
of rasa is the infrastructure and tools which provides the user with high performance, resilient and proprietary
intelligent chatbots that work. Rasa helps all developers create better text and voice-based chatbots. Rasa’s NLU
helps the developers with the technology and the tools necessary for capturing and understanding user input,
determining the intent and entities. Rasa supports multiple languages, single and multiple intent, and both pretrained and custom entities.[5]
Rasa is an open source framework for building AI bots. Rasa open source framework consists of two
components: -</p><p>
Rasa NLU and Rasa core. Rasa recommends using bothRasa NLU and core, but they can be used
independently of each other. Rasa core is the component which handles thedialogue engine for the framework
and helps in creating more complex chatbots with customization. Rasa providesan opportunity for interactive
learning. Chatbots can beenhanced because of the flexibility options provided by the Rasa framework. The
chatbot can be easily deployed, integrated and connected to websites and applications. [5] Rasa being an open
source framework it is very convenientand easy to customize. Most of the chatbot frameworksavailable are
totally cloud based and provide software as a service. Business, enterprises and clients do not wish toshare their
data on cloud or any third-party service. Rasafits the best when you don’t want to send your data to an
external device. We choose rasa as our framework because it is not cloud based and can be easily customized.
Rasaallows the user to build, host and deploy Rasa internally inour server or environment. Deploying the Rasa on
our ownserver can help to secure the data. Rasa provides better control and flexibility in deploying the
chatbot. It is free and open source which makes a go to choice for building chatbots.

    Chatbots are becoming an integral part of the digital world. It is necessary that the customer needs are
addressed as well as customers are satisfied through the business. Customer expectations are growing with
increasing technological development. Customer satisfaction is very important to businesses and enterprises
because if the customers are not satisfied with the service customers never return.
Natural language processing is a vital component of intelligent Chatbot systems. In this paper, a function
framework is designed and the principle of RASA NLU is introduced for the Chatbotsystem.The designed system
integrates RASA NLU and neural network (NN) methods and implementsthe system based on entity extraction
after intent recognition. This paper has compared our methods in recognition accuracy and integrities of entity or
sentence, and has also validated the developed systemin realistic situations. Rather than contacting a person,this
bot helps in making appointments ensuring security.
